🔥 From Zero to Multimodal AI — Made this Project from the teachings of Krish Naik and learnt many things Using OpenAI's CLIP 🔥
This weekend, I've been diving deep into multimodal learning, and I'm super excited to share my latest project:
📌 I built an Image-Text Embedding Engine using OpenAI’s CLIP model that can understand visuals and text in a shared embedding space. Sounds futuristic? Well, here’s what it does:
✅ Upload an image → it converts it into a semantic embedding
 ✅ Compare it to a text prompt or caption
 ✅ Use it for tasks like image search, clustering, tagging, and more!
💻 Built using:
🤖 transformers from Hugging Face
🧠 CLIPModel & CLIPProcessor
🖼️ PIL for image handling
🔍 Normalized embedding space for cosine similarity
⚡ Torch (in eval mode) for fast inference
🧠 Key Learning Areas:
How CLIP bridges vision and language (text & image in same space!)
Handling and pre-processing images with PIL & CLIPProcessor
Converting images to 512-dim embeddings & normalizing them
Efficient inference using torch.no_grad()
Making models reusable for scalable downstream tasks
and i just put it on the streamlit server
🙌 Why this project means a lot:
 I’ve been self-learning AI and machine learning. Every project I build is not just code — it’s a brick in the foundation of my future.
I’m currently diving into LangChain, GenAI, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and looking for internship or open-source collab opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow with real-world AI problems.
💬 Let’s connect if you’re working on:
LLMOps or Multimodal AI
Vector search or Retrieval pipelines
Open-source AI tooling
Or just like building cool stuff with smart people.
👇 I’d love to hear your feedback or suggestions!
